# Welcome

I’m **Jayant Nehra** — an applied AI and data engineer who builds production systems, learns in public, and writes things down so I don’t have to rediscover them later.

This site is a personal workspace:
a mix of notes, experiments, and longer-form writing about systems, data, and applied AI.

## What you’ll find here

- **[About](about.md)** — who I am and how I think about engineering
- **[Portfolio](portfolio.md)** — hobby projects that I am building
- **[Resume](resume.md)** — Professional experience and skills 
- **[Blog](blog/)** — longer-form writings
- **[Notes](notes/)** — technical explanations and learning notes
- **[Snippets](snippets/)** — small pieces of code I reuse

## Current focus

- Applied AI systems and LLM-based workflows  
- Data pipelines and ML platforms  
- Retrieval, evaluation, and observability in production AI  
- Writing clearer explanations of complex systems
