# Notes

Technical explanations, learning notes, and things I figured out. These are evergreen notes that evolve over time.

## Philosophy

These notes follow the [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) approach:

- **Evergreen, not chronological** — Updated over time as I learn more
- **Question-based** — Each note answers a specific question
- **Interconnected** — Notes link to related concepts
- **Unfinished is okay** — Some notes are works in progress

## How to Use These Notes

1. **Start with a question** — Each note title is a question or concept
2. **Follow the links** — Notes reference each other; explore connections
3. **Search** — Use the search bar at the top to find specific topics
4. **Expect incompleteness** — These are learning notes, not finished articles
