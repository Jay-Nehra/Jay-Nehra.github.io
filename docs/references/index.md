# References

Systems-level understanding of Python libraries and modules. Not syntax tutorials—these are deep dives into **what's actually happening** under the hood.

## Philosophy

Each guide answers the questions tutorials skip:

- What happens when we call this function?
- Who calls whom, and when?
- Why is it designed this way?
- What breaks if we misunderstand?

## Structure

Every guide has two parts:

1. **Architecture** — The mental model, the machinery, the "why"
2. **Scenarios** — End-to-end examples that exercise the full system
