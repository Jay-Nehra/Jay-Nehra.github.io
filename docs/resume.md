## Work Experience

### Applied AI Engineer — KornFerry (Contract)  
*Mar 2025 – Present | Remote*

- Rebuilt the end-to-end job standardization pipeline (training, inference, and post-processing) used to map external job data to an evolving internal job architecture across multiple production products.
- Led large-scale training data cleanup and validation, identifying and correcting ~40% noisy or inconsistent historical mappings and improving Top-5 prediction accuracy from 68% to 92%.
- Designed and maintained a Databricks-based ML data platform supporting automated workflows for data preparation, training, evaluation, versioning, and deployment.
- Built a configuration-driven embedding model evaluation framework for benchmarking clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks with automated metrics and reports.
- Improved search performance across two products, reducing end-to-end latency from ~2 minutes to sub-second responses.
- Designed and implemented agentic AI workflows, including MCP servers and AI agents orchestrating actions across internal APIs.
- Defined observability and evaluation standards covering model quality, data drift, and pipeline reliability.
