# Code Snippets

Working code that I've written and will need again. Copy-paste ready solutions to common problems.

## What's Here

Unlike my [Notes](../notes/), which explain concepts, these are practical code snippets with:

- **Working, tested code** that you can copy-paste
- **Problem statement** explaining what it solves
- **When to use** (and when NOT to use)
- **Minimal explanation** — just enough context

## How to Use

1. **Search for your problem** — Use the search bar or browse by language
2. **Read the problem statement** — Make sure it matches your use case
3. **Copy the code** — Click the copy button on code blocks
4. **Adapt as needed** — These are templates, not one-size-fits-all
