# About

I’m an applied AI and data engineer with over five years of experience building production-grade systems, with recent focus on LLM-based applications and AI workflows.

My background spans data engineering, backend systems, and applied machine learning. Over time, my work has shifted toward building end-to-end AI systems, but the surrounding pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and operational tooling that make them reliable in production.

I enjoy working close to real problems: translating ambiguous business logic into systems that can evolve, scale, and be understood by the people who maintain them.

## How I work

A few principles that guide how I approach engineering:

- **Systems over demos** — prototypes are easy; production systems require discipline.
- **Evaluation matters** — if you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.
- **Data is the product** — models reflect the data and workflows around them.
- **Clarity beats cleverness** — especially in long-lived codebases.

I’m comfortable moving between:
- hands-on implementation
- system design
- collaboration with product and domain experts

## This site

This website doubles as:
- a personal knowledge base
- a public learning log
- a portfolio of ideas and systems

Not everything here is polished. Some notes are rough by design.
They exist to capture understanding, not to perform.


## Get in Touch

I'm always happy to chat about:
- Technical questions or collaboration
- Interesting problems you're solving
- Book recommendations or what you're learning
