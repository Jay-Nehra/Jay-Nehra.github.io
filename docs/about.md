# About Me

Hi, I'm **Jayant Nehra** — a developer who enjoys solving problems with code and learning how systems work.

## What I Do

I'm currently working as a [Your Role] at [Your Company], where I focus on:

- Building backend systems and APIs
- Working with Python, Rust, and databases
- Solving performance and scalability challenges
- Writing clean, maintainable code

## Background

I got into programming because [your reason - maybe solving a specific problem, curiosity, etc.]. Since then, I've been fascinated by [areas of interest - systems programming, web development, databases, etc.].

My journey includes:

- **[Year]** — Started learning to code with [language/technology]
- **[Year]** — Built my first [project type]
- **[Year]** — Joined [Company/Project] as [Role]
- **[Year]** — Currently exploring [Current Learning Focus]

## What I'm Interested In

**Technical interests:**
- Systems programming and performance optimization
- Database internals and query optimization
- Distributed systems and reliability
- Clean code and software architecture

**Beyond code:**
- Teaching and mentoring other developers
- Open source contributions
- Technical writing and documentation
- [Your hobbies - hiking, reading, music, etc.]

## This Website

I built this site to:

1. **Migrate my writing** from Medium and other platforms
2. **Learn in public** by sharing notes and discoveries
3. **Build a second brain** of code snippets and solutions
4. **Have a home on the internet** that I control

It's a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) — notes that grow over time rather than polished blog posts.

## Technologies I Use

**Languages:** Python, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, Bash  
**Frameworks:** Flask/FastAPI, React, Node.js  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB  
**Tools:** Docker, Git, Linux, VS Code  
**Cloud:** AWS, GCP (or whatever you use)
