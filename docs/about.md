# About

I'm an applied AI and data engineer with over five years of experience. My work focuses on building production systems for LLM-based applications—data pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and the operational tooling that keeps things running reliably.

My background spans data engineering, backend systems, and applied machine learning. Most of my recent work has been on end-to-end AI systems: not just the models, but the surrounding infrastructure that makes them useful.

## How I approach work

A few things I try to keep in mind:

- **Systems over demos** — Prototypes are straightforward; production systems require discipline.
- **Evaluation matters** — If we can't measure it, we can't improve it.
- **Data shapes everything** — Models reflect the data and workflows around them.
- **Clarity over cleverness** — Especially in code that others will maintain.

## This site

This website is primarily a personal system—a place to keep notes, references, and learning material organized. I moved away from platforms like Notion and Medium to have something I control directly.

It also serves as a professional presence. The resume and portfolio sections are for anyone interested in my work.

Not everything here is polished. Some notes are rough drafts. They exist to capture understanding, not to impress.
