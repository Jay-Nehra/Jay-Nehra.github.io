# Why I Built This Site

I'm consolidating my notes, writings, and reference materials into a markdown-based workflow.

## The Goal

This site serves two purposes:

1. **Personal website** — Portfolio, resume, and professional presence
2. **Knowledge base** — Notes, references, and things I'm learning

## Why Markdown?

- **I own everything** — Content lives in a Git repository I control
- **Simple workflow** — Just text files, no database, no CMS
- **Free hosting** — GitHub Pages costs nothing
- **Future-proof** — Will still work in 10 years without maintenance

## The Stack

- **MkDocs Material** — Static site generator with built-in search
- **GitHub Pages** — Free hosting with custom domain
- **GitHub Actions** — Auto-deploys on every push

Setup took 10 minutes. The focus is on content, not tooling.

*This site grows organically. No pressure, no deadlines, just steady accumulation of knowledge.*
